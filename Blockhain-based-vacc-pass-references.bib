abstract = {To survive in the competitive environment, most organizations have adopted component-based software development strategies in the rapid technology advancement era and the proper utilization of cloud-based services. To facilitate the continuous configuration, reduce complexity, and faster system delivery for higher user satisfaction in dynamic scenarios. In cloud services, customers select services from web applications dynamically. Healthcare body sensors are commonly used for diagnosis and monitoring patients continuously for their emergency treatment. The healthcare devices are connected with mobile or laptop etc. on cloud environment with network and frequently change applications. Thus, organizations rely on regression testing during changes and implementation to validate the quality and reliability of the system after the alteration. However, for a large application with limited resources and frequently change component management activities in the cloud computing environment, component-based system verification is difficult and challenging due to irrelevant and redundant test cases and faults. In this study, proposed a test case selection and prioritization framework using a design pattern to increase the faults detection rate. First, we select test cases on frequently accessed components using observer patterns and, secondly, prioritize test cases on adopting some strategies. The proposed framework was validated by an experiment and compared with other techniques (previous faults based and random priority). Hence, experimental results show that the proposed framework successfully verified changes. Subsequently, the proposed framework increases the fault detection rate (i.e., more than 90%) than previous faults based and random priority (i.e., more than 80% respectively).},

Blockchain technology offers alternatives to unify the standards and their application by consensus algorithm, which considers the validation and secrecy in the insertion of the blocks of transactions in the chain. However, smart contracts can ensure secrecy and the rules of data sharing in blocks in the chain.

abstract = {The world is moving towards progress, to achieve the desired progress, the world should have a healthy population and health records are the projections of an individual's health over time. The centralised approach of maintaining the health records lead to data breaches. According to 2017 Ponemon Cost of Data Breach Study, the cost of the data breach for healthcare organizations estimated to be $380 per record. According to 2016 Breach Barometer Report, 27,314,647 patient records were affected. So we moved towards institution-driven approach of record maintenance, which didn't make much difference with the previously existing one. Since the patient have no control over the data, the chances of data being misused is high. So we need a patient-centered approach which is completely decentralised, which can identify data thefts, prevent data manipulation, and patient has the right in access control. Blockchain Technology serves as a best solution to address all the problems and fulfill the needs. Blockchain being a decentralised and distributed ledger it can also impact on billing, record sharing, medical research, identify thefts and financial data crimes in days to come. Implementation of smart contracts in health care can simplify things even better. Where invoking, record creation and validation will be done on Blockchain. This paper highlights on the patient-driven model of record maintenance using Blockchain technology where smart contracts can be incorporated in future days making it more potential in data exchange. Finding its huge scope, hoping that more researches will be carried out and practically implemented.},

abstract = {The sharing of personal health records can help to improve the accuracy of the doctor's diagnosis and to promote the progress of medical research. Currently, to reduce the maintenance cost of data, personal health records are usually outsourced to a third party such as the cloud service provider. In this case, patients may lose direct control over their personal health records and the semi-trusted cloud service provider may tamper with or reveal personal health records. Therefore, ensuring the privacy and integrity of personal health records and realizing the fine-grained access control are crucial issues when personal health records are shared. As a distributed architecture with decentralized and tamper-proof features, blockchain provides a new way to protect the personal health records sharing system. In this paper, we propose a new personal health records sharing scheme with data integrity verifiable based on blockchain. Aiming at the problems of privacy disclosure, limited keyword search ability and loss of control rights in the process of personal health record sharing, the new scheme uses searchable symmetric encryption and attribute-based encryption techniques to achieve privacy protection, keyword search, and fine-grained access control. Compared with the existing similar schemes, the new scheme allows patients to distribute attribute private key for users, avoiding many security problems caused by the existing of attribute authority in the scheme. Furthermore, the new scheme uses blockchain to manage keys in the scheme, avoiding the single point failure problem of centralized key management. In particular, the new scheme stores the hash values of encrypted personal health records in blockchain, and the related index set is stored in smart contract, which can further improve the efficiency of data integrity verification. Finally, performance evaluation and security analysis indicate that our scheme is secure and feasible for practical use.},

Through Atlas.ti software, the selected keywords were used to analyse through the relevant articles. As a result, 48 codes and 403 quotations were compiled. Manual coding was performed to categorise the quotations. The codes were then mapped onto the network as a mapping process. Notably, 16 solutions fell under two main areas, namely storage optimization and redesign of blockchain. Basically, there are 3 solutions compiled for storage optimization and 13 solutions for the redesign of the blockchain, namely blockchain modelling, read mechanism, write mechanism, and bi-directional network.},

abstract = {Digital identity is one of the oldest and hardest problems on the Internet. There is still no way to use digital credentials to prove our online identity the same way we do in the offline world. This is finally changing. First, the World Wide Web Consortium is standardizing the format of digitally-signed credentials. Secondly, public blockchains can provide decentralized registration and discovery of the public keys needed to verify digital signatures. These two steps pave the way to establish a global public utility for self-sovereign identity—lifetime portable digital identity that does not depend on any central authority and can never be taken away. The Sovrin Network has been designed exclusively for this purpose, including governance (the Sovrin Foundation and the Sovrin Trust Framework), scalability (validator and observer nodes and state proofs), and accessibility (minimal cost and maximum availability). Most importantly, Sovrin implements Privacy by Design on a global scale, including pairwise pseudonymous identifiers, peer-to-peer private agents, and selective disclosure of personal data using zero-knowledge proof cryptography. The emergence of this infrastructure can transform at least four major markets: identity and access management, cybersecurity, RegTech, and data integration. To provide economic incentives for credential issuers, owners, and verifiers, the Sovrin protocol will incorporate a digital token designed expressly for privacy-preserving value exchange. The Sovrin token should enable a global marketplace for digital credentials of all types and value levels together with ancillary markets for digital credential insurance and permissioned first party data (direct from the customer).

Using the polystyrene industry as a case study, this thesis explores the usage of modern natural language processing (NLP) techniques in a deep learning model, known as NEMO, to forecast the demand of a commodity — without requiring downstream companies to share information. In addition, this thesis compares the effectiveness of such an approach with other non-deep learning approaches, specifically an ARIMA model and a gradient boosting model, XGBoost, to demand forecasting. All three models returned large forecast errors. However, NEMO tracked the volatility of actual data better than the ARIMA model. NEMO also had better success in predicting demand than the XGBoost model, returning approximately 20% better Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) scores. This result suggests that NEMO can be improved with better data, but other issues, such as legality of text mining, need to be considered and addressed before NEMO can be used in day-to-day operations. In its current form, NEMO can be used alongside other forecasting models and provide invaluable information about upcoming demand volatility.},

abstract = {Multi-party authorization (MPA) typically involves multiple parties to control and grant access to shared data. MPA is used to solve the insider's attack problem by ensuring that a single authority or party is not acting alone. Currently, almost all existing implementations of MPA are centralized and fall short in providing logs and events related to provenance of granting permissions in a trusted, secure, immutable, auditable, and decentralized manner. Moreover, for sharing data, proxy re-encryption algorithms are often used to give secure access to encrypted shared data. These schemes and algorithms are also centralized and cannot be trusted. In this paper, we propose a fully decentralized blockchain-based solution in which MPA is implemented using Ethereum smart contracts, and proxy re-encryption algorithms (which are computationally expensive) are implemented using multiple oracles to give access to encrypted shared data stored on a public and decentralized storage platform, such as the Interplanetary File Systems (IPFS). The smart contracts help to validate results based on the majority of encrypted results determined by the oracles. For this, we incorporate reputation mechanisms in the proposed smart contracts to rate the oracles based on their malicious and non-malicious behaviors. We present algorithms along with their full implementation, testing, and validation details. We evaluate the proposed system in terms of security, cost, and generalization to show its reliability and practicality. We make the smart contract source code publicly available on Github.},

abstract = {Most enterprise blockchain applications rely on real world trust relationship such as the business in financial institutions, entertainment industry, supply chain industry, transportation, education, healthcare services, etc. Hyperledger aims to advance blockchain technology that confederate in the cross-industry to open standard platform for distributed ledgers, which can transform the way business transactions are controlled globally. As we know currently the model of blockchain have permissionless blockchain and permissioned blockchain, which the permissionless blockchain such as Bitcoin cryptocurrency that anyone can operate a node and participate through spending CPU cycle and demonstrating a proof of work. On the other hand, permissioned blockchain model control who participates in validation and in the protocol. More over these nodes typically have established identities and form a consortium. Therefore, to make the innovation application that need the authority and permission for submitting the transaction we will select the hyperledger fabric framework to develop our project. Hence this paper will focus to study to develop a prototype of healthcare service application in dental clinic service. In order to keep records transactions that are accessible and controlled the authority by participants which it has a transaction id number that generate by hash number mechanism running by hyperledger composer. This application will create a trust relationship wherein the goal is to set up a set of participants in an ecosystem that it needed in health care service in the field of sharing the medical equipment and transaction that can save a variety of costs and make an interoperability process in the clinics.},

@article{Kakarlapudi2021,
abstract = {Blockchain technology was introduced through Bitcoin in a 2008 whitepaper by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto. Since its inception, it has gathered great attention because of its unique properties—immutability and decentralized authority. This technology is now being implemented in various fields such as healthcare, IoT, data management, etc., apart from cryptocurrencies. As it is a newly emerging technology, researchers and organizations face many challenges in integrating this technology into other fields. Consent management is one of the essential processes in an organization because of the ever-evolving privacy laws, which are introduced to provide more control to users over their data. This paper is a systematic review of Blockchain's application in the field of consent and privacy data management. The review discusses the adaptation of Blockchain in healthcare, IoT, identity management, and data storage. This analysis is formed on the principles of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and a process of systematic mapping review. We provide analysis of the development, challenges, and limitations of blockchain technology for consent management.},
